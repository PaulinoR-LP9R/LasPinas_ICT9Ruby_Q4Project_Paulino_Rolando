This 16th-Century town has grown to become a favorite among tourists. While not grand, it carries the charm it once had in the old-world during the Spanish Occupation of the Philippines. Here you can find <i>Calesas</i> (Horse-Drawn Carriages), their signature <i>Ilocos Empanadas</i>, and walk along the old cobble stone streets lined with a variety of souvenirs. If you were ever to come here, get a tour of this place in the first week of May which is when the Vigan Festival of the Arts is held.</p>
