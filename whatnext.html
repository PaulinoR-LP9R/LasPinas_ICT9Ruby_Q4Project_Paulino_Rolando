<p>I'll be completely frank, I'm not sure what will happen next. I'm looking into next year with no idea of what is going to happen, as I'm typing this I've been working for the past 2 or more hours and the debugging was annoying especially for the 3rd Qtr Files. I'm just glad this is over. BTW, that image is made with picrew, it ain't my artwork. But I do hope to get back into my hobbies more and maybe find some more time for myself.

<p>If you've got anything to say, here's a comment box, it does not work since I'm so sleepy as I'm finishing this but feel free to say something!</p>
