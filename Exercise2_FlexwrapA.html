<h1>The Greatness of The Maybe Man</h1>
<div class="container">
<div class="item" style="background-color: red;">
		<h2>The Maybe Man</h2>
		<p>The Maybe Man dives into the ideas of one unable to identify who they are or what they want hence the name "Maybe Man" maybe he is who is he? Maybe he is not. This can be found in the many different verses of the main and opening song "Maybe Man" where each song is mentioning a quality the main singer or the band wishes to have, perfect hindisght, to be memorable, to be unable to feel. The song Maybe Man is also an ingenius way of creating an overture for all of their songs in the playlist by each verse relating to each song in the playlist in some way with each of them possessing the meaning of the songs.</p>

		<h2>Its Songs</h2>
		<p>The Songs of Maybe Man may range from whimsical to downright sad but that is the charm of The Maybe Man. Songs like "God is Really Real" dives into their struggles after the loss of their dad, or Turning Out Pt. iii, the third part to the lengthy series of songs written and sung by Ryan Met of AJR talking about stories of love from learning and realizing love, to rejecting it and coming to terms with how you'll end up or 'turn out' in this terms. Or their most screamed out song 'Inertia' which covers the topic of being unable to feel anything and being stuck in place like it is being affected by inertia itself.</p>
